<p>This program generates <strong>NTC Table C-code</strong> and <strong>NTC Graph</strong>. First of all, you must enter the values, which belongs to ntc and your sistem. If you want to generate NTC Table as a <strong>C-code</strong>, first you must plot the graph, then you can press NTC Table button in order to generate C-code which will be saved in program location.</p>
<p>Vref, supply voltage</p>
<p>Rntc, NTC resistance at 25Â°C</p>
<p>Rv  , pull-up resistor </p>
<p>Bn  , Beta constant(it is in your NTC datasheet, usually approximate 3950)</p>
<p>Rp  , internal resistor in MCU(enter this if exist)</p>
<p>ADC , resolution(for 10; 2^10 = 1024)</p>
<p>ix  , interpolation points</p>
